/**
 *This program models a playing card from the Uno card game. the program know 
 * the four different color suits of a Uno card and the 15 different ranks of a
 * Uno card playable in the game. Many features of this program make it reusable
 * for other programs that also use playing cards. Most card games use ranks \
 * that range form 1-10 and then some more; ranks 2-9 can be utilized in other 
 * programs. final variables Rank and Color can be reused with only some 
 * additions, as well as their getter methods and card constructor. however, 
 * for the code to be reused in the fashion, the enums color and ranks would 
 * need to be in a separate java class and card class would have to call those
 * variables in those files.
 * for this program I did not use the card class made in class, instead made 
 * the program standalone. If I to extend the original Card class, then likely
 * I would implement the changes I suggested in this class, upon the original 
 * Card class in order to make the code reusable. 
 * This class and Card class are mostly identical except for the enums and the 
 * variable names.
